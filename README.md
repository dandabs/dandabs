### Terve, Hi, Hei, Hej, Hæ, Labas, 今日は 👋

🌱​  I'm Dan, and I'm from Northern Ireland (which, believe it or not, is in the UK).

🔭​  I code in a lot of languages, just whatever comes to my head first: C#, Java, Nodejs, Lua - really anything.

📫​  If you're looking to contact me, I'm on Discord at dandabs#2088 or email at itseni@dandabs.fi.

👯​  My main project is my iOS / Android Minecraft-server app, Vesisika, which you can find more about ~~[here](https://vesisika.app)~~ nowhere – abandoned.
