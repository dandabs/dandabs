# Moi, olen Dan | Hæ, ég er Danni 👋

I'm an 18 year old developer who is passionate about learning new things and creating cool stuff. I enjoy collaborating with other people to create even more useless projects.

Some of my biggest projects include:

- 🦮 Vesisika: an iOS and Android app for managing Minecraft servers on-the-go. Built with React-Native and deployed on Firebase.
- 🎥 ÁAOcore: an open-source, adaptable software application for controlling cameras, lighting and pyrotechnics at televised live shows.
- 🥶 IglooCode: a capture the flag competition for Northern Irish KS3 students, supported by Liberty IT, Kainos, and Queen's University.

Outside of programming, I'm a very passionate linguist and aspire to be a polyglot. I love studying the morphology and phonology of Nordic languages and their evolutions from proto-languages to their modern day forms. I also enjoy writing and videography.
