### Terve, Hi, Hei, Hej, Hæ, Labas, 今日は 👋

🌱​  I'm Dan, and I'm from Northern Ireland (which, believe it or not, is in the UK).

🔭​  I code in a lot of languages, just whatever comes to my head first: C#, Java, Nodejs, Lua - really anything.

📫​  If you're looking to contact me, I'm on Discord at dandabs#2088 or email at dandabs@cloudcraftmc.org.uk.

👯​  I'm mainly working on my iOS / Android Minecraft-server app, Vesisika, which you can find more about [here](https://vesisika.app).

🇫🇮​  I'm pretty obsessed with Finland, and pretty much every Nordic country - I speak 5 out of the 8 Nordic languages (to varying levels of fluency).

🐦​  You should follow my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dandabsx) and my Github profile, because I post useless stuff nobody will ever need >:)
